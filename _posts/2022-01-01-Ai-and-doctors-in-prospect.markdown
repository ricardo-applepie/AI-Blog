# AI AND DOCTORS IN PROSPECT; THE MERGE 
Modern changes and growth take on many forms, including the current era of rising technology. Over time it has taken enough trust for the majority to get accustomed to these, because subsequently, there are new trends to look out for. Access to healthcare has never been the easiest and most comfortable, but there is an opportunity for that to change, in a world where digitised health-care is at our disposal - our fingertips.
Knowing this innovation will create an advancement in healthcare, but there are grey areas; does it eliminate the human-doctor experience or advances it? How would the public accept this change (if they eventually do)? There are uncertainties surrounding this development and the outcomes will depend on how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is managed.

### THE NEED FOR AI IN MEDICINE
Informing clinical decisions with data from previous data is the essence of evidence-based medicine. Traditionally, mathematical methods have achieved this function by presenting patterns within data such as mathematical calculations, for example, the linear regression raises the 'most relevant line'. By ‘machine learning’ (ML), AI provides strategies that identify complex organizations that cannot be easily reduced to mathematical proportions.

According to Spatharou et al. (2020), “by 2050, one in four people in Europe and North America will be over the age of 65—this means the health system will have to deal with more patients with complex needs. Managing such patients is expensive and requires systems to shift from an episodic care-based philosophy to one that is much more proactive and focused on long-term care management.”

### THE FATE OF CURRENT AND PROSPECTIVE DOCTORS WITH AI
A single AI system is capable of supporting large numbers and is therefore well suited to situations where human expertise is a rare resource. While this encourages the AI innovation implementation, the fate of future healthcare practitioners (HCPs) are in question; the question of whether the majority of them would be out of career.. How is the AI-HCPs merger regulated? Would older healthcare workers be able to handle this machine learning and manage the developing lifestyle? Would patients trust the AI system? What about potential risks posed? Would this change an inevitable phase brewing?

While this argument is valid, it is paramount to create a bridge between both worlds. How? By a merge, directed to the younger and incoming HCPs. We can imagine a world where the new generation of HCPs are also experts with AI or have the technical know-how. This would create trust for the patients and final consumers of these services.

AI is not replacing human doctors but assisting them. Machines do not have human qualities such as empathy and compassion, so patients should see to it that consultation is led by human doctors. In addition, patients cannot expect to quickly trust AI; technology covered by mistrust. Therefore, AI tends to handle important tasks, but is limited enough in its scope to leave the primary responsibility for patient management to a human physician. There is an ongoing clinical trial that uses AI to calculate targeted areas of head and neck radiotherapy more accurately and more quickly than a person. The invading radiologist is still responsible for finally delivering the treatment but AI plays an important backing role in protecting the patient from harmful radiation.

### FUTURE POSSIBILITIES IN MEDICAL PRACTICE
AI will extract important information from the patient's electronic footprint. Initially this will save time and improve efficiency, but following adequate testing will also directly guide patient management. Take the example of consulting a patient with type 2 diabetes; while the doctor spends valuable time reading outpatient literature, checking blood tests, and obtaining clinical guidelines for many discontinued programs, AI can automatically prepare for the most important risks and actions if a patient's clinical record is provided. It can also automatically convert a recorded consultation dialogue into an abridged letter for the doctor to approve or amend. Both of these applications will save both patients and HCPs a long time and can be used quickly because they help doctors rather than replace them.

As these systems become better validated, they will be given more responsibility. In a patient with type 2 diabetes, the onset of statin may be determined by the AI on an individual basis based on patient history concerns rather than a strictly defined ‘equality-all’ algorithm. The research required for this 'personalized medicine' is only possible if AI cleverly summarizes a wealth of medical knowledge. In addition, because AI is able to simultaneously monitor millions of entries, it will play an important role in preventive medicine. AI can further suggest consultation when determining that a patient's risk of developing a specific diabetes problem requires intervention. On the contrary, it would be impossible to give a person the task of carefully monitoring the results and evaluation of every diabetic patient in real time.

AI-based systems will also bring diagnostic specialists to basic care. If a picture of a skin lesion is sufficient to diagnose its aetiology, the images may be taken by a doctor and sent to a professional dermatology AI system for immediate analysis. Patients identified as low risk will receive immediate confirmation while high-risk patients will receive lower referral waiting times because clinics will only receive selected cases. This concept is not limited to skin lesions, AI has shown the ability to translate many different types of image data including retina scanning, radiographs, and ultrasound. Many of these images can be screened with inexpensive and widely available equipment.

### BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS
Future AI research should be directed to carefully selected activities. Integrating these systems into clinical practice needs to build beneficial relationships between AI and nurses, where AI provides physicians with greater efficiency or cost effectiveness and physicians provide AI with the important clinical exposure they need to learn clinical case management. Throughout this process it will be important to ensure that AI does not obscure the human face of the medical profession because a major obstacle to the widespread adoption of AI will be the public's reluctance to embrace technically contradictory technologies.
